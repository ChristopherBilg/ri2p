## Roadmap & Goals

### v1.0.0

Minimally viable i2p router.

### v2.0.0

Add in router UI. (This will probably be a web server that serves a static site and periodic data refreshes.)

### v3.0.0

Remove all unnecessary dependencies in order to reduce attack-surface. This also includes re-reading all source code in order to pinpoint potential security vulnerabilities.

### v4.0.0+

TBD. Versions at this level will be feature additions and possibly a "module" system that allows the addition of external modules for additional/enhanced features and functionality.
