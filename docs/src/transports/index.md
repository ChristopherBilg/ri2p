# Transports

> "A "transport" in I2P is a method for direct, point-to-point communication between two routers. Transports must provide confidentiality and integrity against external adversaries while authenticating that the router contacted is the one who should receive a given message." [1]

ri2p supports multiple transports simultaneously. These are the two transports currently supported:

- [Secure Semireliable UDP (SSU)](./ssu.md)
- [NIO Transmission Control Protocol (NTCP2)](./ntcp2.md)
