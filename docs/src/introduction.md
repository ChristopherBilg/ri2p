# Introduction

ri2p (Rust-i2p) is a free and open source project that aims to implement the [i2p Specifications](https://geti2p.net/spec) in a minimal, lightweight and memory safe program.

ri2p is written in the Rust systems programming language in order to gain the benefits that Rust provides such as; memory management, memory and type safety, systems-level performance, native cross-compiling support, and an easy-to-use dependency (package) [registry](https://crates.io/).

This website is created using the mdBooks Rust crate, and allows documentation to be transpiled from Markdown to static HTML.

There is another portion of the documentation website, located at [ri2p.com/doc/doc/ri2p](https://ri2p.com/doc/doc/ri2p/), that is built from Rust's native `cargo doc` feature. That portion of the documentation is for other developers to quickly read about the Rust codebase for ri2p.
